Introduction:
=============

There are two seperate services available fo which only 1 should be selected
for use.

Option #1: Setup a Google App engine app to receives live emails and trigger
           Rip Runner automatically with callout information.
           (This option takes less resources and triggers callouts more quickly)
           *NOTE: Make sure you edit app.yaml and incoming-email-webhook.py
           The email address for the google email forwarder should be the format:
           <any name>@<your project name>.appspotmail.com
           example: riprunner@app-riprunner.appspotmail.com
           This is the email address that callout information should be sent to.

Option #2: Setup a Google App engine app to trigger Rip Runner to poll for 
           a new email that should trigger a new callout.
           (This option takes more resouces [polling every minute] and has a time
           lag to trigger callouts of up to 2 minutes)
           *NOTE: Make sure you edit app.yaml and riprunner-trigger.php

In order to use Google App Engine (GAE) to trigger notifications
you should edit the *.yaml files to point to your GAE Account info, and
edit the URL in the PHP or PY file to point to the location where you installed 
Rip Runner application
